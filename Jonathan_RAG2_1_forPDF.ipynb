            "3. Formulating vigilance committee within the plantation community to ensure proper coordination, feedback flow of information and decision taking etc. by the individual estate.\n",
            "4. Continuing awareness on COVID-19 spread and encouraging stay at home and line room.\n",
            "5. Maintaining records and census of all resident individuals, visitors, influx personnel from other regions and countries, workers with reduced immunity and suffering from diabetes, heart, kidney, liver, asthma and lung diseases, age over 40 years.\n",
            "6. Advising staff to minimize direct verbal communication between co-workers and use alternative methods (Public address system, intercom etc.) to provide instructions to workers and staff members.\n",
            "7. Discouraging workers from the use of other workers’ baskets, sacks, knives, mobile phones, pens and common telephones, desks and equipment etc. If any object has been shared, it must be cleaned with soap and water or with minimum 70% v/v alcohol-based sanitizer.\n",
            "8. Conducting review meetings periodically to monitor, obtain feedback and improve systems.\n",
            "9. In the event of detecting a suspected case at workplace, seeking assistance from hotline 1390 and following the instructions given or alternatively transferring the worker to the nearest government hospital, by ambulance. Suwasariya ambulance service can be contacted by dialing 1990.\n",
            "10. Deploying workers with less risk: persons with reduced immunity and suffering from diabetes, heart, kidney, liver, asthma and lung diseases, and age over 40 years are vulnerable.\n",

            "**Field Guidelines**\n",

            "2. Avoiding gatherings at musters, weighing sheds, tea break, transport etc. and always maintaining one meter minimum distance between workers while working and moving.\n",
            "3. Allocating tea rows in such a way to ensure always minimum of one-meter distance.\n",
            "4. Deploying workers on alternate basis to maintain social distance and avoid continuous exposure.\n",
            "5. Ensuring proper use of suitable masks by all staff and workers and gloves only on occasions, if necessary.\n",
            "6. Promoting good hand hygiene among workers at all critical points by providing appropriate Alcohol-based hand sanitizing mixtures/soap and washing areas.\n",
            "7. Discouraging sharing of farm implements at work and sharing food, tea, beetle leaf and smoking and other items viz. masks, bags, level sticks etc.\n",
            "8. Offering tea breaks batch-wise in a manner to gather at few locations than one location.\n",
            "9. Encouraging TRI shear, harvesting and pruning machines to minimize worker involvement.\n",
