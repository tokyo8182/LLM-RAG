Lack of water bodies, geographical limitations and inability to use conventional irrigation techniques such as flood and furrow irrigation have hindered the application of irrigation in tea plantations. Introduction of micro irrigation techniques viz. drip and sprinkler irrigation, frequent drought occurrences and productivity improvements etc. have prompted stakeholders to seek alternative techniques to manage soil moisture levels. Also, high impact droughts, impacts of climate change and poor replanting rates have created renewed interests in adopting suitable irrigation techniques. It is evident that rudimentary to modern irrigation techniques have been practiced in tea fields although adoption of such techniques is not feasible in the entire plantation. However, there are tea fields, where irrigation could be applied with the development of in-situ water bodies. Since management of soil moisture levels plays a pivotal role in sustainable crop production, it is necessary to advise stakeholders to take correct decisions on adoption of suitable irrigation techniques. This guideline serves as a basis for decision making on irrigation as a potential drought mitigation strategy in tea plantation.\\n\\n# Selection of irrigation as an option for drought mitigation\\n\\nThere are many other drought mitigation techniques recommended by the TRI (Please refer Advisory Circular No. PA 2 on Drought Mitigation in Tea Plantations, Issued in January 2011). However, unlike those strategies, irrigation involves critical technical inputs and financial commitments. Therefore, decision making should be economically viable. Hence, it is necessary to carefully analyze the drought effects in a particular location or estate and decide whether such damage can be prevented by other less costly drought mitigation techniques.\\n\\n# Fields to be irrigated\\n\\n1. Newly planted tea fields are more vulnerable to drought, as their root system has not fully developed. Returns in investments for irrigation would be higher in the long term when new clearings (immature fields) are irrigated.\\n2. Low elevation tea plantations are more vulnerable to drought because of high ambient temperature during dry periods.\\n3. Within estates too, there could be fields, frequently subjected to drought damage due to the geographic location, poor soil and presence of drought susceptible cultivars. High yielding cultivars usually gives higher returns to irrigation.\\n\\nPage 1 of 3\\n# 4. Irrigation of tea fields earmarked for pruning is usually not economical, unless they are threatened with death of plants due to drought.\\n\\n# Requirements for irrigation\\n\\nBefore making the final decision on irrigation, following factors need to be carefully considered.\\n\\n1. Availability of water source: Availability of a permanent and a reliable water source is essential for successful irrigation during the drought. In view of this, potential maximum duration of drought according to the estate location needs to be found. Many water sources in tea estates are dry during severe drought periods. It is also necessary to ascertain whether the use of water source for irrigation affects estate community and down streams users to avoid potential social conflicts.\\n2. If such a reliable water source is not available: It should either be developed (e.g. Irrigation well) or water should be transported from the bowsers, as and when necessary. However, it should be remembered that transportation would increase operational cost depending on the distance to the water source.\\n3. Selection of irrigation system: Depends on the level of investment, type of water source and technical expertise available to maintain the system etc.\\n\\n# Selection of irrigation method/system\\n\\nIrrigation can be done manually or by using permanent or portable irrigation system. The permanent irrigation system can be either drip or sprinkler irrigation.\\n\\n# Manual irrigation\\n\\nManual watering is the most popular irrigation method in tea plantations, where water is applied to plants by workers manually. Normally, water is transported by a bowser or rarely using a nearby water source. Advantage of this method is that there is no investment cost for an irrigation system. However, operational cost would be high as workers have to be employed for irrigation. The chances for under irrigation that could result in a poor response, is also one of the main disadvantages.\\n\\n# Drip irrigation\\n\\nDrip irrigation is the application of irrigation water through emitters fixed to an irrigation tube. The most economical drip irrigation system for tea is the in-line drip tubes. It is the most efficient irrigation water application system which ensures uniform water application throughout the field. Pressure requirements to operate a drip system are low. Also, application of irrigation water through drips prevent unnecessary wetting of plant stems.\\n# Sprinkler irrigation\\n\\nSprinkler irrigation can be done by a permanent set of sprinklers or a mobile sprinkler head. Alternatively, gun-type mobile sprinkler heads, capable of covering a radius usually more than 15 m, could also be used. Investment cost for such gun-type sprinkler is lower. However, additional man power is necessary to operate such systems in the field.\\n\\nThe operation and maintenance of the system is user friendly. Also, it gives a cooling effect to the plant micro environment, which is important during drought periods. In addition to drought mitigation, sprinklers can be used to minimize frost damage in tea at high elevation. Some disadvantages of the sprinkler irrigation system are high energy use, low application efficiency and potential theft and vandalism of the permanent irrigation equipment.\\n\\n# Economics of irrigation\\n\\nReturn on investment for irrigation depends mainly on investment/operational cost and plant response to irrigation (yield increment and plant survival). The investment and operational cost vary according to the irrigation system. Estimation of system cost needs to be obtained through a service provider or vendor. Based on the potential drought damage, return on investment for irrigation could also be worked out. In general, investment cost for drip irrigation system for a unit area is higher than the permanent sprinkler irrigation systems. However, water application efficiency for drip irrigation system is higher than that of sprinkler irrigation systems. Hence drip irrigation system is best suited for water limited locations. Mobile gun-type sprinkler irrigator could be used as a low investment strategy depending on the exigencies of the situation.\\n\\n# Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\nCopyright\\nAll rights reserved.

Lack of water bodies, geographical limitations and inability to use conventional irrigation techniques such as flood and furrow irrigation have hindered the application of irrigation in tea plantations. Introduction of micro irrigation techniques viz. drip and sprinkler irrigation, frequent drought occurrences and productivity improvements etc. have prompted stakeholders to seek alternative techniques to manage soil moisture levels. Also, high impact droughts, impacts of climate change and poor replanting rates have created renewed interests in adopting suitable irrigation techniques. It is evident that rudimentary to modern irrigation techniques have been practiced in tea fields although adoption of such techniques is not feasible in the entire plantation. However, there are tea fields, where irrigation could be applied with the development of in-situ water bodies. Since management of soil moisture levels plays a pivotal role in sustainable crop production, it is necessary to advise stakeholders to take correct decisions on adoption of suitable irrigation techniques. This guideline serves as a basis for decision making on irrigation as a potential drought mitigation strategy in tea plantation.\\n\\n# Selection of irrigation as an option for drought mitigation\\n\\nThere are many other drought mitigation techniques recommended by the TRI (Please refer Advisory Circular No. PA 2 on Drought Mitigation in Tea Plantations, Issued in January 2011). However, unlike those strategies, irrigation involves critical technical inputs and financial commitments. Therefore, decision making should be economically viable. Hence, it is necessary to carefully analyze the drought effects in a particular location or estate and decide whether such damage can be prevented by other less costly drought mitigation techniques.\\n\\n# Fields to be irrigated\\n\\n1. Newly planted tea fields are more vulnerable to drought, as their root system has not fully developed. Returns in investments for irrigation would be higher in the long term when new clearings (immature fields) are irrigated.\\n2. Low elevation tea plantations are more vulnerable to drought because of high ambient temperature during dry periods.\\n3. Within estates too, there could be fields, frequently subjected to drought damage due to the geographic location, poor soil and presence of drought susceptible cultivars. High yielding cultivars usually gives higher returns to irrigation.\\n\\nPage 1 of 3\\n# 4. Irrigation of tea fields earmarked for pruning is usually not economical, unless they are threatened with death of plants due to drought.\\n\\n# Requirements for irrigation\\n\\nBefore making the final decision on irrigation, following factors need to be carefully considered.\\n\\n1. Availability of water source: Availability of a permanent and a reliable water source is essential for successful irrigation during the drought. In view of this, potential maximum duration of drought according to the estate location needs to be found. Many water sources in tea estates are dry during severe drought periods. It is also necessary to ascertain whether the use of water source for irrigation affects estate community and down streams users to avoid potential social conflicts.\\n2. If such a reliable water source is not available: It should either be developed (e.g. Irrigation well) or water should be transported from the bowsers, as and when necessary. However, it should be remembered that transportation would increase operational cost depending on the distance to the water source.\\n3. Selection of irrigation system: Depends on the level of investment, type of water source and technical expertise available to maintain the system etc.\\n\\n# Selection of irrigation method/system\\n\\nIrrigation can be done manually or by using permanent or portable irrigation system. The permanent irrigation system can be either drip or sprinkler irrigation.\\n\\n# Manual irrigation\\n\\nManual watering is the most popular irrigation method in tea plantations, where water is applied to plants by workers manually. Normally, water is transported by a bowser or rarely using a nearby water source. Advantage of this method is that there is no investment cost for an irrigation system. However, operational cost would be high as workers have to be employed for irrigation. The chances for under irrigation that could result in a poor response, is also one of the main disadvantages.\\n\\n# Drip irrigation\\n\\nDrip irrigation is the application of irrigation water through emitters fixed to an irrigation tube. The most economical drip irrigation system for tea is the in-line drip tubes. It is the most efficient irrigation water application system which ensures uniform water application throughout the field. Pressure requirements to operate a drip system are low. Also, application of irrigation water through drips prevent unnecessary wetting of plant stems.\\n# Sprinkler irrigation\\n\\nSprinkler irrigation can be done by a permanent set of sprinklers or a mobile sprinkler head. Alternatively, gun-type mobile sprinkler heads, capable of covering a radius usually more than 15 m, could also be used. Investment cost for such gun-type sprinkler is lower. However, additional man power is necessary to operate such systems in the field.\\n\\nThe operation and maintenance of the system is user friendly. Also, it gives a cooling effect to the plant micro environment, which is important during drought periods. In addition to drought mitigation, sprinklers can be used to minimize frost damage in tea at high elevation. Some disadvantages of the sprinkler irrigation system are high energy use, low application efficiency and potential theft and vandalism of the permanent irrigation equipment.\\n\\n# Economics of irrigation\\n\\nReturn on investment for irrigation depends mainly on investment/operational cost and plant response to irrigation (yield increment and plant survival). The investment and operational cost vary according to the irrigation system. Estimation of system cost needs to be obtained through a service provider or vendor. Based on the potential drought damage, return on investment for irrigation could also be worked out. In general, investment cost for drip irrigation system for a unit area is higher than the permanent sprinkler irrigation systems. However, water application efficiency for drip irrigation system is higher than that of sprinkler irrigation systems. Hence drip irrigation system is best suited for water limited locations. Mobile gun-type sprinkler irrigator could be used as a low investment strategy depending on the exigencies of the situation.\\n\\n# Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\nCopyright\\nAll rights reserved.

Lack of water bodies, geographical limitations and inability to use conventional irrigation techniques such as flood and furrow irrigation have hindered the application of irrigation in tea plantations. Introduction of micro irrigation techniques viz. drip and sprinkler irrigation, frequent drought occurrences and productivity improvements etc. have prompted stakeholders to seek alternative techniques to manage soil moisture levels. Also, high impact droughts, impacts of climate change and poor replanting rates have created renewed interests in adopting suitable irrigation techniques. It is evident that rudimentary to modern irrigation techniques have been practiced in tea fields although adoption of such techniques is not feasible in the entire plantation. However, there are tea fields, where irrigation could be applied with the development of in-situ water bodies. Since management of soil moisture levels plays a pivotal role in sustainable crop production, it is necessary to advise stakeholders to take correct decisions on adoption of suitable irrigation techniques. This guideline serves as a basis for decision making on irrigation as a potential drought mitigation strategy in tea plantation.\\n\\n# Selection of irrigation as an option for drought mitigation\\n\\nThere are many other drought mitigation techniques recommended by the TRI (Please refer Advisory Circular No. PA 2 on Drought Mitigation in Tea Plantations, Issued in January 2011). However, unlike those strategies, irrigation involves critical technical inputs and financial commitments. Therefore, decision making should be economically viable. Hence, it is necessary to carefully analyze the drought effects in a particular location or estate and decide whether such damage can be prevented by other less costly drought mitigation techniques.\\n\\n# Fields to be irrigated\\n\\n1. Newly planted tea fields are more vulnerable to drought, as their root system has not fully developed. Returns in investments for irrigation would be higher in the long term when new clearings (immature fields) are irrigated.\\n2. Low elevation tea plantations are more vulnerable to drought because of high ambient temperature during dry periods.\\n3. Within estates too, there could be fields, frequently subjected to drought damage due to the geographic location, poor soil and presence of drought susceptible cultivars. High yielding cultivars usually gives higher returns to irrigation.\\n\\nPage 1 of 3 # 4. Irrigation of tea fields earmarked for pruning is usually not economical, unless they are threatened with death of plants due to drought.\\n\\n# Requirements for irrigation\\n\\nBefore making the final decision on irrigation, following factors need to be carefully considered.\\n\\n1. Availability of water source: Availability of a permanent and a reliable water source is essential for successful irrigation during the drought. In view of this, potential maximum duration of drought according to the estate location needs to be found. Many water sources in tea estates are dry during severe drought periods. It is also necessary to ascertain whether the use of water source for irrigation affects estate community and down streams users to avoid potential social conflicts.\\n2. If such a reliable water source is not available: It should either be developed (e.g. Irrigation well) or water should be transported from the bowsers, as and when necessary. However, it should be remembered that transportation would increase operational cost depending on the distance to the water source.\\n3. Selection of irrigation system: Depends on the level of investment, type of water source and technical expertise available to maintain the system etc.\\n\\n# Selection of irrigation method/system\\n\\nIrrigation can be done manually or by using permanent or portable irrigation system. The permanent irrigation system can be either drip or sprinkler irrigation.\\n\\n# Manual irrigation\\n\\nManual watering is the most popular irrigation method in tea plantations, where water is applied to plants by workers manually. Normally, water is transported by a bowser or rarely using a nearby water source. Advantage of this method is that there is no investment cost for an irrigation system. However, operational cost would be high as workers have to be employed for irrigation. The chances for under irrigation that could result in a poor response, is also one of the main disadvantages.\\n\\n# Drip irrigation\\n\\nDrip irrigation is the application of irrigation water through emitters fixed to an irrigation tube. The most economical drip irrigation system for tea is the in-line drip tubes. It is the most efficient irrigation water application system which ensures uniform water application throughout the field. Pressure requirements to operate a drip system are low. Also, application of irrigation water through drips prevent unnecessary wetting of plant stems. # Sprinkler irrigation\\n\\nSprinkler irrigation can be done by a permanent set of sprinklers or a mobile sprinkler head. Alternatively, gun-type mobile sprinkler heads, capable of covering a radius usually more than 15 m, could also be used. Investment cost for such gun-type sprinkler is lower. However, additional man power is necessary to operate such systems in the field.\\n\\nThe operation and maintenance of the system is user friendly. Also, it gives a cooling effect to the plant micro environment, which is important during drought periods. In addition to drought mitigation, sprinklers can be used to minimize frost damage in tea at high elevation. Some disadvantages of the sprinkler irrigation system are high energy use, low application efficiency and potential theft and vandalism of the permanent irrigation equipment.\\n\\n# Economics of irrigation\\n\\nReturn on investment for irrigation depends mainly on investment/operational cost and plant response to irrigation (yield increment and plant survival). The investment and operational cost vary according to the irrigation system. Estimation of system cost needs to be obtained through a service provider or vendor. Based on the potential drought damage, return on investment for irrigation could also be worked out. In general, investment cost for drip irrigation system for a unit area is higher than the permanent sprinkler irrigation systems. However, water application efficiency for drip irrigation system is higher than that of sprinkler irrigation systems. Hence drip irrigation system is best suited for water limited locations. Mobile gun-type sprinkler irrigator could be used as a low investment strategy depending on the exigencies of the situation.\\n\\n# Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\nCopyright\\nAll rights reserved.

Sri Lanka is also currently experiencing COVID-19 threat. Globally, COVID-19 pandemic will create significant impacts on economies and Sri Lanka is not exempted being an upper middle-income country. This will certainly create adverse outcomes in the health, social and economic settings in short, medium and longer terms.\\n\\nCOVID-19 is a respiratory disease and the transmission takes place via following 3 routes:\\n\\n1. Droplets - The virus can be transmitted by breathing infected droplets. Droplets can be produced during coughing or sneezing or even by exhales from infected persons. These droplets travel up to a distance of 1m.\\n2. Direct - Person to person transmission by direct contact with an infected person (Eg. Hugging, Shaking hands). The virus enters the body through nose, mouth or eyes.\\n3. Indirect \\u2013 When an infected person coughs, sneezes or exhales, droplets of infected fluid may release and contaminate nearby surfaces and objects, such as desks, tables, telephones, computers etc. An uninfected person may come in contact the virus by touching these surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.\\n\\nTherefore, individual workplaces should adopt best practices to avoid such transmissions through the routes described herein. Individual behavior is also important in arresting transmission of this virus.\\n\\nTwo simple measures adopted in public namely wearing face masks and not touching the face could protect any individual from infecting with this virus.\\n\\nIn the present context, workplaces need to modify the practices and their working environments to prevent any possible transmission of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, stakeholders in the tea plantations are hereby advised to adopt the following guidelines at their workplaces viz. tea field, factory and office, while complying with the Government directives and Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medical Services guidelines issued time to time.\\n\\nThe staff and workers of following categories should not report for work;\\n\\n1. Those having fever, with or without acute onset respiratory symptoms such as cough, runny nose, sore throat and/or shortness of breath.\\n2. Those who have had contact with suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 for the last 14 days\\n3. Those who are quarantined for COVID-19.\\n\\n1\\n# 4. Those who are occupying premises and/or housing schemes declared as self-quarantine areas for suspected cases of COVID-19.\\n\\nA large number of people are frequently gathered at the workplaces, it is a collective responsibility of persons to keep workplaces safe and healthy. The lead responsibility for the implementation of this guideline lies with the management of each organization.\\n\\nAll staff and workers need to adhere to the recommendations append below in order to avoid possible transmission of COVID-19 infection.\\n\\n# General\\n\\n1. Identifying a suitable focal point (a responsible officer) to coordinate, monitor and control activities implemented against COVID-19 infection and provides necessary guidance.\\n2. Formulating a task force in each estate representing the management, field, factory, medical and welfare staff, and safety officer/s and community members as deemed necessary.\\n3. Formulating vigilance committee within the plantation community to ensure proper coordination, feedback flow of information and decision taking etc. by the individual estate.\\n4. Continue awareness on COVID-19 spread and encourage stay at home and line room.\\n5. Maintaining records and census of all resident individuals, visitors, influx personnel from other regions and countries, workers with reduced immunity and suffering from diabetes, heart, kidney, liver, asthma and lung diseases, age over 40 years.\\n6. Advise staff to minimize direct verbal communication between co-workers and use alternative methods (Public address system, intercom etc.) to provide instructions to workers and staff members.\\n7. Discourage workers from the use of other workers\\u2019 baskets, sacks, knives, mobile phones, pens and common telephones, desks and equipment etc. If any object has been shared, it must be cleaned with soap and water or with minimum 70% v/v alcohol-based sanitizer.\\n8. Conduct review meetings periodically to monitor, obtain feedback and improve systems.\\n9. In the event of detecting a suspected case at workplace, seek assistance from hotline 1390 and follow the instructions given or alternatively transfer the worker to the nearest government hospital, by ambulance. Suwasariya ambulance service can be contacted by dialing 1990.\\n10. Deploy workers with less risk: persons with reduced immunity and suffering from diabetes, heart, kidney, liver, asthma and lung diseases, and age over 40 years are vulnerable.\\n# At Field\\n\\n1. Limit agricultural practices to essential operations such as plucking, weeding, fertilizing, pruning and nursery upkeep. Additionally, shade lopping and blister blight control in plantations receiving monsoon rain.\\n2. Avoid gatherings at musters, weighing sheds, tea break, transport etc. and always maintain one meter minimum distance between workers while working and moving.\\n3. Allocate tea rows in such a way to ensure always minimum of one-meter distance.\\n4. Deploy workers on alternate basis to maintain social distance and avoid continuous exposure.\\n5. Ensure proper use of suitable masks by all staff and workers and gloves only on occasions, if necessary.\\n6. Promote good hand hygiene among workers at all critical points by providing appropriate Alcohol-based hand sanitizing mixtures/soap and washing areas.\\n7. Discourage sharing of farm implements at work and sharing food, tea, beetle leaf and smoking and other items viz. masks, bags, level sticks etc.\\n8. Offer tea breaks batch wise in a manner to gather at few locations than one location.\\n9. Encourage TRI shear, harvesting and pruning machines to minimize worker involvement.\\n10.

Restrict worker movements from one area to another as far as possible.\\n7. Discourage sharing of food, beetle and common utensils.\\n8. Encourage measures to minimize worker involvement.\\n9. Encourage completing work at one stretch.\\n10. Provide tea breaks batch wise or section by section.\\n11. Disinfect all equipment, machinery, uniforms and vehicles.\\n12. Clean/disinfect door handles, railings and toilets regularly.\\n13. Ensure persons involved in transportation bought leaf, refuse tea and firewood etc. practice hand hygiene, cough etiquette and wearing masks, and limit number of external vehicles.\\n14. Dispatch teas to Colombo with extreme care, and provide lorry driver and helper with personal hygiene guidance, sanitizers and masks for disinfecting and regular use in transportation.\\n# 15. Comply with food hygiene standards\\n\\nby implementing stringent measures during transportation, handling, auctions, sampling for tests, processing, packaging and warehousing for shipping with traceability records.\\n\\n# At the Estate office premise\\n\\n1. Ensure practice of hand hygiene at the entry to office by providing washing facilities with sanitizers, cough etiquette and wearing masks, and promote regular hand washings.\\n2. Rearrange office to ensure social distancing at work and avoid direct contacts within and outsiders, and may establish a barrier/shield for cashier counter.\\n3. Establish alternate days and/or extra shifts reducing total number of employees in the work place and personal contacts.\\n4. Avoid unnecessary gatherings and meetings with both internal and external persons. Arrange tea and lunch breaks batch-wise to prevent crowding the meal room.\\n5. Maintain routine cleaning and disinfecting surfaces, office equipment, door handles and toilets etc.\\n6. Adopt waste management and garbage disposal, cleaning and disinfecting protocols.\\n7. Discourage staff use others desks/work stations, common telephones, fax machines, pens, calculators, and also sharing food, tea, chewing beetle leaf etc.\\n8.

Lack of water bodies, geographical limitations and inability to use conventional irrigation techniques such as flood and furrow irrigation have hindered the application of irrigation in tea plantations. Introduction of micro irrigation techniques viz. drip and sprinkler irrigation, frequent drought occurrences and productivity improvements etc. have prompted stakeholders to seek alternative techniques to manage soil moisture levels. Also, high impact droughts, impacts of climate change and poor replanting rates have created renewed interests in adopting suitable irrigation techniques. It is evident that rudimentary to modern irrigation techniques have been practiced in tea fields although adoption of such techniques is not feasible in the entire plantation. However, there are tea fields, where irrigation could be applied with the development of in-situ water bodies. Since management of soil moisture levels plays a pivotal role in sustainable crop production, it is necessary to advise stakeholders to take correct decisions on adoption of suitable irrigation techniques. This guideline serves as a basis for decision making on irrigation as a potential drought mitigation strategy in tea plantation.\\n\\n# Selection of irrigation as an option for drought mitigation\\n\\nThere are many other drought mitigation techniques recommended by the TRI (Please refer Advisory Circular No. PA 2 on Drought Mitigation in Tea Plantations, Issued in January 2011). However, unlike those strategies, irrigation involves critical technical inputs and financial commitments. Therefore, decision making should be economically viable. Hence, it is necessary to carefully analyze the drought effects in a particular location or estate and decide whether such damage can be prevented by other less costly drought mitigation techniques.\\n\\n# Fields to be irrigated\\n\\n1. Newly planted tea fields are more vulnerable to drought, as their root system has not fully developed. Returns in investments for irrigation would be higher in the long term when new clearings (immature fields) are irrigated.\\n2. Low elevation tea plantations are more vulnerable to drought because of high ambient temperature during dry periods.\\n3. Within estates too, there could be fields, frequently subjected to drought damage due to the geographic location, poor soil and presence of drought susceptible cultivars. High yielding cultivars usually gives higher returns to irrigation.\\n\\nPage 1 of 3\\n# 4. Irrigation of tea fields earmarked for pruning is usually not economical, unless they are threatened with death of plants due to drought.\\n\\n# Requirements for irrigation\\n\\nBefore making the final decision on irrigation, following factors need to be carefully considered.\\n\\n1. Availability of water source: Availability of a permanent and a reliable water source is essential for successful irrigation during the drought. In view of this, potential maximum duration of drought according to the estate location needs to be found. Many water sources in tea estates are dry during severe drought periods. It is also necessary to ascertain whether the use of water source for irrigation affects estate community and down streams users to avoid potential social conflicts.\\n2. If such a reliable water source is not available: It should either be developed (e.g. Irrigation well) or water should be transported from the bowsers, as and when necessary. However, it should be remembered that transportation would increase operational cost depending on the distance to the water source.\\n3. Selection of irrigation system: Depends on the level of investment, type of water source and technical expertise available to maintain the system etc.\\n\\n# Selection of irrigation method/system\\n\\nIrrigation can be done manually or by using permanent or portable irrigation system. The permanent irrigation system can be either drip or sprinkler irrigation.\\n\\n# Manual irrigation\\n\\nManual watering is the most popular irrigation method in tea plantations, where water is applied to plants by workers manually. Normally, water is transported by a bowser or rarely using a nearby water source. Advantage of this method is that there is no investment cost for an irrigation system. However, operational cost would be high as workers have to be employed for irrigation. The chances for under irrigation that could result in a poor response, is also one of the main disadvantages.\\n\\n# Drip irrigation\\n\\nDrip irrigation is the application of irrigation water through emitters fixed to an irrigation tube. The most economical drip irrigation system for tea is the in-line drip tubes. It is the most efficient irrigation water application system which ensures uniform water application throughout the field. Pressure requirements to operate a drip system are low. Also, application of irrigation water through drips prevent unnecessary wetting of plant stems.\\n# Sprinkler irrigation\\n\\nSprinkler irrigation can be done by a permanent set of sprinklers or a mobile sprinkler head. Alternatively, gun-type mobile sprinkler heads, capable of covering a radius usually more than 15 m, could also be used. Investment cost for such gun-type sprinkler is lower. However, additional man power is necessary to operate such systems in the field.\\n\\nThe operation and maintenance of the system is user friendly. Also, it gives a cooling effect to the plant micro environment, which is important during drought periods. In addition to drought mitigation, sprinklers can be used to minimize frost damage in tea at high elevation. Some disadvantages of the sprinkler irrigation system are high energy use, low application efficiency and potential theft and vandalism of the permanent irrigation equipment.\\n\\n# Economics of irrigation\\n\\nReturn on investment for irrigation depends mainly on investment/operational cost and plant response to irrigation (yield increment and plant survival). The investment and operational cost vary according to the irrigation system. Estimation of system cost needs to be obtained through a service provider or vendor. Based on the potential drought damage, return on investment for irrigation could also be worked out. In general, investment cost for drip irrigation system for a unit area is higher than the permanent sprinkler irrigation systems. However, water application efficiency for drip irrigation system is higher than that of sprinkler irrigation systems. Hence drip irrigation system is best suited for water limited locations. Mobile gun-type sprinkler irrigator could be used as a low investment strategy depending on the exigencies of the situation.\\n\\n# Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\nCopyright\\nAll rights reserved.

Sri Lanka is also currently experiencing COVID-19 threat. Globally, COVID-19 pandemic will create significant impacts on economies and Sri Lanka is not exempted being an upper middle-income country. This will certainly create adverse outcomes in the health, social and economic settings in short, medium and longer terms.\\n\\nCOVID-19 is a respiratory disease and the transmission takes place via following 3 routes:\\n\\n1. Droplets - The virus can be transmitted by breathing infected droplets. Droplets can be produced during coughing or sneezing or even by exhales from infected persons. These droplets travel up to a distance of 1m.\\n2. Direct - Person to person transmission by direct contact with an infected person (Eg. Hugging, Shaking hands). The virus enters the body through nose, mouth or eyes.\\n3. Indirect \\u2013 When an infected person coughs, sneezes or exhales, droplets of infected fluid may release and contaminate nearby surfaces and objects, such as desks, tables, telephones, computers etc. An uninfected person may come in contact the virus by touching these surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.\\n\\nTherefore, individual workplaces should adopt best practices to avoid such transmissions through the routes described herein. Individual behavior is also important in arresting transmission of this virus.\\n\\nTwo simple measures adopted in public namely wearing face masks and not touching the face could protect any individual from infecting with this virus.\\n\\nIn the present context, workplaces need to modify the practices and their working environments to prevent any possible transmission of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, stakeholders in the tea plantations are hereby advised to adopt the following guidelines at their workplaces viz. tea field, factory and office, while complying with the Government directives and Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medical Services guidelines issued time to time.\\n\\nThe staff and workers of following categories should not report for work;\\n\\n1. Those having fever, with or without acute onset respiratory symptoms such as cough, runny nose, sore throat and/or shortness of breath.\\n2. Those who have had contact with suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 for the last 14 days\\n3. Those who are quarantined for COVID-19.\\n\\n1 # At Field\\n\\n1. Limit agricultural practices to essential operations such as plucking, weeding, fertilizing, pruning and nursery upkeep. Additionally, shade lopping and blister blight control in plantations receiving monsoon rain.\\n2. Avoid gatherings at musters, weighing sheds, tea break, transport etc. and always maintain one meter minimum distance between workers while working and moving.\\n3. Allocate tea rows in such a way to ensure always minimum of one-meter distance.\\n4. Deploy workers on alternate basis to maintain social distance and avoid continuous exposure.\\n5. Ensure proper use of suitable masks by all staff and workers and gloves only on occasions, if necessary.\\n6. Promote good hand hygiene among workers at all critical points by providing appropriate Alcohol-based hand sanitizing mixtures/soap and washing areas.\\n7. Discourage sharing of farm implements at work and sharing food, tea, beetle leaf and smoking and other items viz. masks, bags, level sticks etc.\\n8. Offer tea breaks batch wise in a manner to gather at few locations than one location.\\n9. Encourage TRI shear, harvesting and pruning machines to minimize worker involvement.\\n10. Disinfect all, field equipment, machinery, uniforms, vehicles and other personal objects.\\n\\n# At Factory\\n\\n1. Deploy workers on rotation basis to minimize personal contacts.\\n2. Maintain social distancing at least with a 1 meter at all times.\\n3. Practice hand hygiene at critical points by providing washing facilities with sanitizers, cough etiquette and wearing masks.\\n4. Avoid gatherings at unloading and weighing points, and tea break etc.\\n5. Ensure sufficient ventilation in the processing areas.\\n6. Restrict worker movements from one area to another as far as possible.\\n7. Discourage sharing of food, beetle and common utensils.\\n8. Encourage measures to minimize worker involvement.\\n9. Encourage completing work at one stretch.\\n10. Provide tea breaks batch wise or section by section.\\n11. Disinfect all equipment, machinery, uniforms and vehicles.\\n12. Clean/disinfect door handles, railings and toilets regularly.\\n13. Ensure persons involved in transportation bought leaf, refuse tea and firewood etc. practice hand hygiene, cough etiquette and wearing masks, and limit number of external vehicles.\\n14. Dispatch teas to Colombo with extreme care, and provide lorry driver and helper with personal hygiene guidance, sanitizers and masks for disinfecting and regular use in transportation. # 15. Comply with food hygiene standards\\n\\nby implementing stringent measures during transportation, handling, auctions, sampling for tests, processing, packaging and warehousing for shipping with traceability records.\\n\\n# At the Estate office premise\\n\\n1. Ensure practice of hand hygiene at the entry to office by providing washing facilities with sanitizers, cough etiquette and wearing masks, and promote regular hand washings.\\n2. Rearrange office to ensure social distancing at work and avoid direct contacts within and outsiders, and may establish a barrier/shield for cashier counter.\\n3. Establish alternate days and/or extra shifts reducing total number of employees in the work place and personal contacts.\\n4. Avoid unnecessary gatherings and meetings with both internal and external persons. Arrange tea and lunch breaks batch-wise to prevent crowding the meal room.\\n5. Maintain routine cleaning and disinfecting surfaces, office equipment, door handles and toilets etc.\\n6. Adopt waste management and garbage disposal, cleaning and disinfecting protocols.\\n7. Discourage staff use others desks/work stations, common telephones, fax machines, pens, calculators, and also sharing food, tea, chewing beetle leaf etc.\\n8. Keep doors and windows open in order to improve ventilation and avoid regular handling.\\n9. Advise staff to minimize verbal and written communication among co-workers and promote use of alternative methods (public address system, intercom etc.) for internal communication.\\n10. Minimize cash handling and formalize the distribution of food materials, etc. and introduce alternate means to avoid personal contacts.\\n\\n# Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n# COPYRIGHT\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

Lack of water bodies, geographical limitations and inability to use conventional irrigation techniques such as flood and furrow irrigation have hindered the application of irrigation in tea plantations. Introduction of micro irrigation techniques viz. drip and sprinkler irrigation, frequent drought occurrences and productivity improvements etc. have prompted stakeholders to seek alternative techniques to manage soil moisture levels. Also, high impact droughts, impacts of climate change and poor replanting rates have created renewed interests in adopting suitable irrigation techniques. It is evident that rudimentary to modern irrigation techniques have been practiced in tea fields although adoption of such techniques is not feasible in the entire plantation. However, there are tea fields, where irrigation could be applied with the development of in-situ water bodies. Since management of soil moisture levels plays a pivotal role in sustainable crop production, it is necessary to advise stakeholders to take correct decisions on adoption of suitable irrigation techniques. This guideline serves as a basis for decision making on irrigation as a potential drought mitigation strategy in tea plantation.\\n\\n# Selection of irrigation as an option for drought mitigation\\n\\nThere are many other drought mitigation techniques recommended by the TRI (Please refer Advisory Circular No. PA 2 on Drought Mitigation in Tea Plantations, Issued in January 2011). However, unlike those strategies, irrigation involves critical technical inputs and financial commitments. Therefore, decision making should be economically viable. Hence, it is necessary to carefully analyze the drought effects in a particular location or estate and decide whether such damage can be prevented by other less costly drought mitigation techniques.\\n\\n# Fields to be irrigated\\n\\n1. Newly planted tea fields are more vulnerable to drought, as their root system has not fully developed. Returns in investments for irrigation would be higher in the long term when new clearings (immature fields) are irrigated.\\n2. Low elevation tea plantations are more vulnerable to drought because of high ambient temperature during dry periods.\\n3. Within estates too, there could be fields, frequently subjected to drought damage due to the geographic location, poor soil and presence of drought susceptible cultivars. High yielding cultivars usually gives higher returns to irrigation.\\n\\nPage 1 of 3 # 4. Irrigation of tea fields earmarked for pruning is usually not economical, unless they are threatened with death of plants due to drought.\\n\\n# Requirements for irrigation\\n\\nBefore making the final decision on irrigation, following factors need to be carefully considered.\\n\\n1. Availability of water source: Availability of a permanent and a reliable water source is essential for successful irrigation during the drought. In view of this, potential maximum duration of drought according to the estate location needs to be found. Many water sources in tea estates are dry during severe drought periods. It is also necessary to ascertain whether the use of water source for irrigation affects estate community and down streams users to avoid potential social conflicts.\\n2. If such a reliable water source is not available: It should either be developed (e.g. Irrigation well) or water should be transported from the bowsers, as and when necessary. However, it should be remembered that transportation would increase operational cost depending on the distance to the water source.\\n3. Selection of irrigation system: Depends on the level of investment, type of water source and technical expertise available to maintain the system etc.\\n\\n# Selection of irrigation method/system\\n\\nIrrigation can be done manually or by using permanent or portable irrigation system. The permanent irrigation system can be either drip or sprinkler irrigation.\\n\\n# Manual irrigation\\n\\nManual watering is the most popular irrigation method in tea plantations, where water is applied to plants by workers manually. Normally, water is transported by a bowser or rarely using a nearby water source. Advantage of this method is that there is no investment cost for an irrigation system. However, operational cost would be high as workers have to be employed for irrigation. The chances for under irrigation that could result in a poor response, is also one of the main disadvantages.\\n\\n# Drip irrigation\\n\\nDrip irrigation is the application of irrigation water through emitters fixed to an irrigation tube. The most economical drip irrigation system for tea is the in-line drip tubes. It is the most efficient irrigation water application system which ensures uniform water application throughout the field. Pressure requirements to operate a drip system are low. Also, application of irrigation water through drips prevent unnecessary wetting of plant stems. # Sprinkler irrigation\\n\\nSprinkler irrigation can be done by a permanent set of sprinklers or a mobile sprinkler head. Alternatively, gun-type mobile sprinkler heads, capable of covering a radius usually more than 15 m, could also be used. Investment cost for such gun-type sprinkler is lower. However, additional man power is necessary to operate such systems in the field.\\n\\nThe operation and maintenance of the system is user friendly. Also, it gives a cooling effect to the plant micro environment, which is important during drought periods. In addition to drought mitigation, sprinklers can be used to minimize frost damage in tea at high elevation. Some disadvantages of the sprinkler irrigation system are high energy use, low application efficiency and potential theft and vandalism of the permanent irrigation equipment.\\n\\n# Economics of irrigation\\n\\nReturn on investment for irrigation depends mainly on investment/operational cost and plant response to irrigation (yield increment and plant survival). The investment and operational cost vary according to the irrigation system. Estimation of system cost needs to be obtained through a service provider or vendor. Based on the potential drought damage, return on investment for irrigation could also be worked out. In general, investment cost for drip irrigation system for a unit area is higher than the permanent sprinkler irrigation systems. However, water application efficiency for drip irrigation system is higher than that of sprinkler irrigation systems. Hence drip irrigation system is best suited for water limited locations. Mobile gun-type sprinkler irrigator could be used as a low investment strategy depending on the exigencies of the situation.\\n\\n# Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\nCopyright\\nAll rights reserved.
